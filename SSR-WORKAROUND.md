# SSR Build Issue - Workaround

## Issue
The production build fails with `ReferenceError: self is not defined` due to Supabase JS v2 using browser globals during server-side rendering.

## Root Cause
`@supabase/supabase-js` v2 references browser-specific globals (`self`) at the module level, causing failures during Next.js's static page generation.

## Current Workarounds Applied
1. Removed `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` and `@supabase/ssr` packages
2. Created SSR-safe Supabase client with lazy initialization
3. Added polyfills via instrumentation.ts
4. Set output to 'standalone' to reduce static optimization

## Development Works Fine
The app runs correctly in development mode (`npm run dev`). The issue only affects production builds.

## Temporary Solution for Deployment
Since Vercel deployment is failing, you can:

1. **Deploy without static optimization:**
   - The app is configured with `output: 'standalone'`
   - This creates a Node.js server that can be deployed

2. **Use development mode on server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Alternative: Build locally and deploy built files:**
   ```bash
   # Build will fail but create partial output
   npm run build || true
   # Deploy the .next folder to your server
   ```

## Permanent Fix Options
1. **Downgrade to Supabase JS v1** (not recommended - missing features)
2. **Wait for Supabase JS v3** with better SSR support
3. **Use a different database client** for SSR pages
4. **Disable SSR for pages using Supabase** (add `'use client'` directive)

## Current Status
- ✅ Development mode works perfectly
- ✅ All performance optimizations in place (except React Query)
- ✅ Service Worker caching implemented
- ✅ Lazy loading implemented
- ❌ Production build fails due to Supabase SSR incompatibility
