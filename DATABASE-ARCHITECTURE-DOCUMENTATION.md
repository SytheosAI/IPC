# IPC Database Architecture Fix - Complete Documentation

**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Author:** System Architect  
**Status:** Complete  

## Executive Summary

The IPC application database has been completely restructured to implement proper multi-tenancy and fix the critical RLS (Row Level Security) policy violations that were preventing project creation. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the solution.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause of Issues

1. **RLS Policy Recursion**: Helper functions were querying tables that had RLS policies referencing those same functions
2. **Missing Organization Context**: Tables lacked proper `organization_id` foreign keys
3. **Incomplete Multi-Tenancy**: No organizational isolation between different companies
4. **Data Persistence Issues**: Strict RLS policies were blocking legitimate data creation

### Symptoms Experienced

- Error: "Failed to create project: new row violates row-level security policy for table vba_projects"
- Projects not persisting in database
- Inconsistent data access across the application

## Solution Architecture

### Multi-Tenancy Design

```
ORGANIZATIONS (Root Entity)
├── PROFILES (Users belong to organization)
├── PROJECTS (Organization-scoped)
├── VBA_PROJECTS (Organization-scoped) 
├── FIELD_REPORTS (Organization-scoped)
├── DOCUMENTS (Organization-scoped)
├── INSPECTIONS (Organization-scoped)
├── CONTACTS (Organization-scoped)
└── SUBMITTALS (Organization-scoped)
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Single Organization Root**: Every entity traces back to an organization
2. **Automatic Assignment**: New records automatically inherit user's organization
3. **Data Isolation**: Users can only access data from their organization
4. **Beta Testing Support**: Default organization for all existing data

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes

#### 1. Organizations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    -- Company information, settings, metadata
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 2. Multi-Tenancy Columns
Every data table now includes:
```sql
organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

#### 3. Helper Functions (Non-Recursive)
```sql
-- Safe function that doesn't trigger RLS recursion
CREATE FUNCTION get_user_organization_id() RETURNS UUID
-- Direct query without RLS to avoid circular dependencies
```

#### 4. Simplified RLS Policies
```sql
-- Example: VBA Projects Policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage vba projects in their org" ON vba_projects
    FOR ALL USING (organization_id = get_user_organization_id());
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Beta Organization
- **ID**: `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`  
- **Purpose**: Houses all existing data for beta testing
- **Name**: IPC Beta Organization

#### 2. Automatic Organization Assignment
- New profiles auto-assigned to beta org if none specified
- New records inherit user's organization via triggers
- Prevents orphaned data

#### 3. Data Preservation
- All existing data migrated to beta organization
- No data loss during migration
- Maintains data integrity for ongoing projects

#### 4. Security Model
- Organization-based data isolation
- Users only see data from their organization
- Admins can modify organization settings
- Non-recursive RLS policies prevent circular dependencies

## Tables Implemented

### Core Tables
1. **organizations** - Root entity for multi-tenancy
2. **profiles** - User profiles with organization context
3. **projects** - Project management with organization isolation
4. **vba_projects** - VBA projects with organization context
5. **field_reports** - Field reports scoped to organization
6. **documents** - Document management with organization isolation
7. **inspections** - Inspection data with organization context
8. **contacts** - Contact management scoped to organization
9. **submittals** - Submittal tracking with organization context

### Supporting Tables
- All related tables (photos, comments, etc.) inherit organization context through parent relationships

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS) Strategy

1. **Non-Recursive Functions**: Helper functions query directly without triggering RLS
2. **Organization-Based Isolation**: Users can only access their organization's data
3. **Automatic Assignment**: New records inherit organization context
4. **Admin Privileges**: Organization admins can modify settings

### Permission Model

| Role | Organizations | Profiles | Projects | VBA Projects | Reports | Documents |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **Member** | Read Own | Read Org | All Org | All Org | All Org | All Org |
| **Admin** | Read/Update Own | Read Org | All Org | All Org | All Org | All Org |

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes Created
```sql
-- Organization-based indexes for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_organization ON profiles(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_organization ON projects(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_vba_projects_organization ON vba_projects(organization_id);
-- ... and more for all tables
```

### Query Optimization
- Organization-scoped queries use indexes effectively
- Helper functions are marked as STABLE for caching
- Proper foreign key constraints enable query optimization

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Schema Updates
1. Drop conflicting RLS policies
2. Add organization_id columns to all tables
3. Create organizations table
4. Add foreign key constraints

### Step 2: Data Migration
1. Create beta organization
2. Assign all existing records to beta organization
3. Update foreign key references

### Step 3: Security Implementation
1. Create non-recursive helper functions
2. Implement simplified RLS policies
3. Add automatic assignment triggers

### Step 4: Verification
1. Test project creation (original failing operation)
2. Verify data isolation between organizations
3. Confirm performance benchmarks

## Testing & Verification

### Automated Tests Included
- **Table Structure Verification**: Confirms all required tables exist
- **Foreign Key Verification**: Validates organization relationships
- **RLS Policy Verification**: Confirms security policies are active
- **Function Verification**: Tests helper functions work correctly
- **Data Migration Verification**: Confirms all data has organization context
- **Project Creation Test**: Tests the originally failing operation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new VBA project (should succeed)
- [ ] View projects from different organizations (should be isolated)
- [ ] Test user profile creation (should auto-assign organization)
- [ ] Verify admin functions work correctly

## Usage Instructions

### For Deployment
1. Execute `FIX-DATABASE-ARCHITECTURE-COMPLETE.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Execute `VERIFY-DATABASE-FIX.sql` to confirm everything works
3. Monitor logs for any RLS policy violations

### For Development
```sql
-- Get user's organization
SELECT get_user_organization_id();

-- Check organization access
SELECT has_organization_access('org-uuid-here');

-- Get user role
SELECT get_user_role();
```

### For Adding New Organizations
```sql
INSERT INTO organizations (name, slug, legal_name, main_email)
VALUES ('New Company', 'new-company', 'New Company LLC', 'admin@newcompany.com');
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **RLS Policy Violations**: Should be zero after fix
2. **Query Performance**: Organization-scoped queries should be fast
3. **Data Growth**: Monitor organization size limits
4. **User Assignment**: Ensure all users have organization context

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Organization Cleanup**: Remove inactive organizations
2. **Index Maintenance**: Reindex organization-based indexes periodically
3. **Security Audit**: Review RLS policies for new tables
4. **Performance Tuning**: Monitor slow queries and optimize

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Organization Settings UI**: Allow admins to configure organization settings
2. **User Invitation System**: Invite users to specific organizations
3. **Organization Switching**: Allow users to belong to multiple organizations
4. **Advanced Permissions**: Role-based permissions within organizations

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Partition Tables**: Consider partitioning large tables by organization
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implement organization-aware caching
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement per-organization rate limits
4. **Backup Strategy**: Organization-specific backup and restore

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **RLS Policy Violation**: Check if user has organization assigned
2. **Data Not Visible**: Verify user is in correct organization
3. **Performance Issues**: Check organization indexes exist
4. **Foreign Key Violations**: Ensure organization exists before creating records

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check user's organization
SELECT p.*, o.name as org_name 
FROM profiles p 
JOIN organizations o ON p.organization_id = o.id 
WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid();

-- Check organization data counts
SELECT o.name, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects WHERE organization_id = o.id) as projects,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vba_projects WHERE organization_id = o.id) as vba_projects
FROM organizations o;
```
